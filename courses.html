      We are excited to announce that courses on technical analysis will soon be made available to our community. While we understand that there has been a delay in launching these courses, we want to assure you that this delay is primarily due to our commitment to delivering high quality content.
      Our team is diligently working to collect and refine the necessary details, conducting thorough research to ensure that our technical analysis courses are comprehensive and beneficial to all who seek to learn. We believe that this investment in research and development is vital to your success.

      <p class="para_tag">Once all the research and development are completed to our satisfaction, we will notify you about the impending launch. Before we release our products, we will seek further permission and input from our esteemed shareholders, ensuring that your interests are considered.
      In the meantime, we invite you to follow us on YouTube, where we offer free learning resources and updates. Our YouTube channel will serve as a valuable source of knowledge to help you get started on your journey into technical analysis.
